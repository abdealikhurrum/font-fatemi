font-fatemi
===========
This is a fork of the original AlFatemi font project started many years ago to enable Lisan ud Dawat to be written digitally. Due to their long history, these fonts have grown to be synonymous with digitized Lisan ud Dawat, and they are commonly used by many speakers of Lisan ud Dawat.
FatemiMaqala is a modified version of ALFATEMILSD (and its variants), and AlFatemi[mn] is a variant of AlFatemi1424 (the first Unicode-standards based Lisan ud Dawat font. The aim of these modifications is to enable cross-platform use of these fonts through conformance with Unicode standards and using OpenType features.
Currently, FatemiMaqala is the more developed of the two. However, they are both ready for use in production environments.
